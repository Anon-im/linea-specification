The present \hashInfoMod{} module is a tiny and very simple module used only to record the (predicted) output of various (nontrivial) \texttt{KECCAK} hashes required by the \zkEvm{}.
There are three scenarios that require such hashes:
(\emph{a}) the execution of an \textbf{unexceptional} \inst{SHA3} opcode provided with \textbf{nonempty input data}
(\emph{b}) the execution of an \textbf{unexceptional} and \textbf{unaborted} \inst{CREATE2} opcode provided with \textbf{nonempty initialization code} 
(\emph{c}) the execution of an \textbf{unexceptional} \inst{RETURN} opcode in a deployment context which deploys \textbf{nonempty byte code}.
