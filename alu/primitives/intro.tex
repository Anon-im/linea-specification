The \textbf{Arithmetic and Logic Unit} module, or \textbf{alu} module for short, deals with most arithmetic instructions. It isn't a single module, we have simply chosen to corral the following four sub-modules under a common umbrella. Each specializes in different tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the \textbf{adder} module deals with addition and subtraction;
	\item the \textbf{multiplier} module deals with multiplication and exponentiation;
	\item the \textbf{modular arithmetic} module deals with the \emph{two-argument} modular instructions;
	\item the \textbf{extended modular arithmetic} module deals with \emph{three-argument} modular instructions. 
\end{enumerate}
