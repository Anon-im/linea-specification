The \textbf{multiplier submodule} deals with the following instructions:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \col{MUL}
	\item \col{EXP}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent \col{EXP} is dealt with in a sequence of ``square and multiply's'' unless (a) the result can be guessed in advance (i.e. $\oli = 1$) or (b) the result is $0$. 

\red{Note. It used to be the case, in a previous draft, that $\oli = 1$ was equivalent to $\argTwo = 0$ and that the $\oli$ would only intervene for \inst{EXP} instructions (and spit out $1$.)}
