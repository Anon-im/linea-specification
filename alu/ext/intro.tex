The present section deals with the following two instructions:
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \inst{ADDMOD}
		\item \inst{MULMOD}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent In the following sections we provide details as to how we will constrain these instructions. Doing so requires finding 
constraints for the \emph{integer product of two $256$-bit integers},
see section~\ref{subsec (alu/ext): integer product of 256-bit integers},
as well as 
constraints for the \emph{euclidean division of a $512$-bit integer by a $256$-bit integer},
see section~\ref{subsec (alu/ext): large euclidean divisions}.
