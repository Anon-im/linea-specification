Adding more and more constraints to the mix:
- github issue per instruction family
- Ã©chaffaudage (heartbeat)
- triggering modules through the HUB rather than module by module with TracePreOpCode()
  - Q: what is the impact of doing this module by module ?
  - Concretely: more signals
  - Clear advantage: closer to the constraints and the expected triggering conditions
- update the instruction decoder
  - certain things changed in the DECODED_FLAG's
- DOM / SUB stamps
- connexions:
  - OOB
  - MXP
  - STP
  - EXP
  - MMU
- simple instruction families:
  - everything arithmetic
  - batch data & BLOCKHASH
  - 
- duplicate the HUB spec's setXxxInstructionBlaBla methods in the Java implementation
