The present section selects the rows of supposed $G_2$ points that are predicted not to belong to $G_2$.
These are sent off to the relevant ``$G_2$ membership'' circuit.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \If $\notOnGTwoAccMax_{i} = 1$ \Then
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item
                  $\acceptablePairOfPoints_{i} = 0$
              \item\label{prc: ec data: successful pairing: setting G2 non membership}
                  $\membershipTestRequired _{i}  =  \notOnGTwo_{i}$
              \item
                  \If $\membershipTestRequired _{i} = 1$ \Then $\isInfinity_{i} = 0$
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
In other words we select a large point for the $G_2$ nonmembership test (i.e. $\membershipTestRequired _{i} \equiv 1$) if and only if said point was (the only)
chosen large point nondeterministically marked as not belonging to the $G_2$ subgroup ($\notOnGTwo_{i} \equiv 1$);
furthermore this point may not be the point at infinity.
