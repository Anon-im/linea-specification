## François

- François mentions issue with corset interleaving constraints
- unaccounted for values appearing in the interleaving of columns produced during MXP tests
- Interest in the debugging

## David

- small amount of work on BIN and related stuff
- most of the time spent on the go corset stuff
- splitting time between FV and Go port and Rust fixes
- some time spent on the Rust tool
  - If condition expansion fix
  - "expression::void"
- ordering of interleaving is nondeterministic and depends on build (changes from one build to another)
- building define.go had issues (presumably large constant) "exponent very large number"
- debugging the binary constraints and the `:bianry@prove` for binary columns in perspectives
