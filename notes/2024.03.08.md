# ALEX

- still working on SIGNEXTEND
- similar to BYTE, but more complicated
- need to formulate properties, slight challenge
- automation would help here (in theory)
	- derive intermediate properties / lemmas
	- doing it properly is challenging
	- also should be resistant to small changes
	- simple approach: we have patterns in Croset (plateau, counter-constancy, byte dec)
	- can be detected
	- provide lemmas to help Z3 to reason about difficult cases
	- did Nethermind use model checking or spacer ?
- automation will run into bugs and get stuck ...


# Joanne

- not much work in the last week
- completeness proof of ADD with variable number of rows
- adjusting existing proof
- new constraints are supported & completeness proved
- STP module (soundness)
  - CREATE(2) ok
  - POOP may be missing counter-constancy ?
  - CALL instructions are WIP
