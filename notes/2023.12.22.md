Worked on BIN module and SIGNEXTEND.
No issues found in BIN module.
Version: the latest version of the spec (with IS_AND, ...) 
But for SIGNEXTEND there is an issue (SMALL isn't counter-constant)
BYTE done in terms of bug-hunting pov.

BUG-hunting:
- make sure there are no issues
- bounded model checking with extra assumptions
- it's a kind of "weak proof"
- make assumptions that are "obvious" to people but would actually require a formal proof that is long
- not necessary to verify stuff like "our byte extraction method coincides with a computer's division by the appropriate power of 256 followed by taking modulo"

SMT solver still has issues reasoning about non linear stuff.

Would like to start looking at the hub in toy cases (e.g. single instruction bytecode)
