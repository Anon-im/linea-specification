- refactoring of rewriting engine
- support for constants
- new technique (parametrized model checking)
- ``max length'' business
- huge number of properties e.g. in BIN
- we can set constants to smaller values to make model checking faster (e.g. LLARGE <-- 4)
- note that for those instructions the `LLARGE` is hardcoded into the constraints (byte decomposition of the leading byte e.g.)
- even so BYTE and SIGNEXTEND don't work
- for work with variable lenght instructions (currently max length = 4)
- sometimes model checking is quick, other times it doesn't work
- tried applying this to SHF, too, but not working
- reworked BIN module, ok for everything except BYTE and SIGNEXTEND
- those were already the performance bottlenecks
- not working with Python transpilation yet
