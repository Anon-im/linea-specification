# Alex

- Working on EUC and verification of it
- Maybe some constraints wrt CT_MAX are useless ?
- Easy to implement an dinvestigate performance issues
- Bounded Model chencking does run in to perf issues
- E.g. because if you have 8 rows you could have 7 padding rows & one row computation
- Or 1 padding row and 7 computation row or
- 1 padding row and 2 computations (3 rows + 4 rows)
- Etc.

Conclusion: there was a mistake in the translation of the spec to Lisp.

# Joanne

- Model Checking vs Fully verified
- Looking at changes in the WCP module (var. length instruction)
- Working on further automation

# Planning

- Alex:
	- [[working on an instruction level rather than on a module level]]
	- preparation for working on a transaction level
	- a single instruction can trigger many modules
	- main problem: SMT solver issues
	- model checking + backward/forward induction is a good model (e.g. produces counter-examples)
	- issue: glueing stuff together in an ``proving instructions'' approach
	- Lean auto feature (which attempts to prove stuff on its own) with various SMT backends (e.g. z3)
	- Lean may be useful in our context
	- replace Python with Lean
	- low level modules are simple
	- objective is to prove the more important stuff (instructions)
	- this can be done incrementally:
		- if no exceptions
		- if one arg is bla ...
	- sampling / testing derived from this approach
	- [[fuzz testing of completeness]]
	- [[look for optimizations / factorizations]]
		- formal methods provide an approach for that
		- experiment with different approaches to implement logic
		- [equality saturation], [synthesis] <= may help us find equivalent formulations that are cheaper
		- choose best implementation according to some metric
		- complex project but doable
		- also check for redundancies (e.g. de facto boolean columns that are enforced to be boolean)
	- Valentin WÃ¼stholz
		- completeness could also be tested with his fuzzer
		- as could the Corset "compiler"
- Joanne
	- scripts that go trhough constraints one by one to remove them and see if redundant
	- keep chipping away at modules
	- going to something that is stateful soon
	- adding lots of automation (it's getting there)
	- Q: Corset to Dafny pipeline, how far along ?
