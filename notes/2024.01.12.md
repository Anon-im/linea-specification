2024.01.12 notes

Olivier:
- implemnted some optimizations
	* variable length instructions in WCP, ADD and BIN
	* new EUC module to offload work from the MMU
- MMU
	* reworking so that none of the computations are done _in situ_
- HUB
	* some precompiles are finally done (SHA2, RIPEMD) others are wip (IDENTITY, MODEXP)
	* remaining ones will follow

Alex:
=====

experimenting with new approach
uninterpreted functions <=> skolemization technique
instead of existential quantifier you introduce new constant
e.g. for binary operations you have bitwise operations
avoids introducing quantifiers (uneasy with SMT)
instantiation requires new axioms
(for the new constants)

benefits:
uninterpreted functions can help with byte/bit decompositions for e.g. the BIN module

solution that avoids bit vectors
currently we use unbounded integers for everything
Sometimes we know that a cell is small (<16 or some power of 2)
SMT solvers have native support of such numbers (bit vectors)
different type of variable
bit operations / shifting will be much more efficient like so


Is this change for a particular module ?
- will benefit everywhere
- BIN, WCP or SHF:
	We want to select a particular byte in there to do work with it
	For SMT solver this is a problem (nonlinear) and it can struggle

we can say we have a byte extraction function that gets byte + index of interest
instead of implementing it with division and remainder we can describe it axiomatically

Question:
- how do we connect the two ? axiomatic approach vs implementation as constraints ?

Yes, requires equivalence proof.

It's basically a black box (opaque) that makes the SMT solving easier.

We have similar patterns (e.g. extract particular bytes) in many places.

Joanne:
=======

variation of structure leading to simplification of structure
Looking at MXP module soon but first wants to look at variable length instructions


2023 recap:
===========

good few months.
Simpler than testing.
Quick updates for WCP/ADD etc spec updates with existing framework for Alex.
The problem is difficult from the reasoning pov so we need lemmas, but fewer than expected
Better coverage than just tests, too.
