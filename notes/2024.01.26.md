# Notes from 2024.12.26

## Alex

implementing manual approach with uninterpreted functions for BIN functions
e.g. select `select-byte` function that extracts specific byte from an integer
Still some performance issues but improvement over e.g. explicit formula version
Able to write spec for that and model check it
Current spec is successfully verified
Previous spec has issues for some reason
MyPy tool to do static type inference from EVM execution spec
could generate tests

There are many perf issues:
- non linear computations
- big formulas

We don't inline the definitinos of the uninterpreted functions
We just constrain its behaviour
When included it's like an opaque term

These uninterpreted functions could be shared between modules
e.g.
- EXP
- RLP

Both have a requirement for computing some log_256 (rounded up)
The axiomatics of these fucntiosn can be shared


## David

Agreed upon system for constraint format
- forward / backwards induction
Code can generated Dafny lemmas
e.g. bounds on CT's and CT_MAX's etc

applied to WCP, looking at BIN

Uniformize names for constraints
- last-row
- lastRow
- final_row

Adding assumptions of smallness
Or for the vanishing of the second argument for ISZERO in WCP


Want to write properties in the corset file sfor formla verification
Example: in the WCP ''it should be the case taht CT <= CT_MAX < 16"
There are no constraints that do that directly
The constraints should imply this
These are useful for formal verification
"intermediate propterties" make formal verification work faster
Also there is some taggin system where properties are either forward induction or backward induction
Also doesn't impose high burden on SMT solver
These properties are added into the underlying corset file
Could be written in theory by constraints people, but not trivial to know which ones to include nor whether b/f
Typically when we have some property that we don't
E.g. EUC has DONE which is de facto binary

Constraints (properties) can have no direction either, be "direct".

Alex:
EUC model checked with latest constraints (dropping DONE[N] = 1 when not all padding)
But we should revert it.
Lookups can be implemented as preconditions / properties on some rows !
But this applies also to implicit smallness conditions (e.g. if we look up into WCP then the arguments must be small)
