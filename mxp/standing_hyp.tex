\[
	\boxed{%
	\text{All constraints in section~(\ref{mxp: sec: specialized constraints}) and all its subsections assume }%
	\begin{cases}
		\mxpStamp_{i} \neq 0 \\
		\noop_{i} + \roob_{i} = 0 \\
	\end{cases}
	}
\]
Different subsections may impose further constraints. These stack onto the standing hypothesis (but not onto one another.) 

\saNote{} Given that $\noop + \roob$ is binary (see note~(\ref{mxp: noop: roob + noop is binary})) one may replace the precondition
``$\noop_{i} + \roob_{i} =    0$'' with
``$\noop_{i} + \roob_{i} \neq 1$'' in the implementation.
