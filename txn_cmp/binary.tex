We ask that the columns $\txFullTip$ and $\txIsTypeTwo$ be binary.

\saNote{} Columns which are preceded by the ``transaction data symbol'' $\transactionSignifier$ are imports from the transaction data module. The binary conditions on $\txIsTypeTwo$ and $\txFullTip$ need not be inforced here and will be omitted from the implementation.
