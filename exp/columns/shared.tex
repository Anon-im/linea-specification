We say that a row $i$ with
$\expStamp_{i} =    0$ is a \textbf{padding-row} and that
$\expStamp_{i} \neq 0$ is a \textbf{non-padding-row}.
We say that a row $i$ with  $\isComputation_{i} = 1$         is a \textbf{computation-row},
that a row $i$ with         $\isMacro_{i} = 1$         is a \textbf{macro-instruction-row}
and that a row $i$ with     $\isPreprocessing_{i} = 1$ is a \textbf{preprocessing-row}.
% Computation rows are used to execute certain computations.
% Macro-instruction rows receive ``macro-instructions'' from the \hubMod{}.
% Preprocessing-rows carry out certain comparisons that are required to ...
