We impose the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\flagSumPerspective$ is binary  \quad (\trash)
    \item \If $\expStamp_{i} =    0$ \Then $\flagSumPerspective_{i} = 0$
    \item \If $\expStamp_{i} \neq 0$ \Then $\flagSumPerspective_{i} = 1$
\end{enumerate}
The above thus enforces that
$\isComputation$,
$\isMacro$ and
$\isPreprocessing$
are indeed exclusive binary columns.
It also enforces that every non-padding-row is part of precisely one of these perspectives.
