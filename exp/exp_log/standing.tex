Throughout section~(\ref{exp: exp log base 256}), \nameref{exp: exp log base 256}, and all its subsections we make the following assumption:
\[
    \boxed{\text{All constraints and shorthand definitions assume that}
        \begin{cases}
            \isExpLog _{i} = 1 \\
            \isMacro  _{i} = 1 \\
        \end{cases}}
\]
In other words row $i$ contains a macro-instruction of type $\expInstExpLog$, the preceding rows are ``computation-rows'' and the following row is a ``pre-processing-row.''
