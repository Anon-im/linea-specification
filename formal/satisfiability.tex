We want a satisfiability / completeness theorem Ã  la
\begin{thm}[Completeness]
	For any valid state transition $\state \rightsquigarrow \state'$ associated with the execution of transactions there ought to exist a trace $\fullTrace$ such taht 
	\[
		\zkEvmConstRel
		\Big[ \state, \big(\text{tx}_a\big)_{a};
		\fullTrace;
		\state' \Big]
		\equiv \mTrue.
	\]
\end{thm}
