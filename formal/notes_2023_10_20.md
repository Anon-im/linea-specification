# Updates

Alex worked on implementing the ADD module in Dafny and SMT
what ADD verification would look like in Dafny (valid inputs, specification of validity)
There are two approaches: **column** and **row** based implementations

**row** based approach:
- Soundness and completeness theorems are formulatable
- Drawback: it needs to access other rows (shifts)

**column** based approach:
- better suited in this regard (shifts)
- the theorems in this case look like Corset: almost one to one translation of Corset, and ability to talk about shifts
Harder for Dafny vs SMT solver
Theorem for one request in the column model
    - DAFNY is able to find a proof for one chunk of rows
    - chunk = 1 padding row + 16 rows for an instruction
Theorem for many requests / arbitrary length traces in the row model

outcome: ISBELL/HOL better suited for arbitrary traces, SMT for simple stuff
DAFNY has issues with mathematics, in particular finite field operations (though doable @joanne)
(interactive) theorem provers have FFA (finite fied arithmetic) encoded
There are SMT solvers that support FFA and nonlinear operations 
DAFNY will be a problem (e.g. OR <=> multiplication in our arithmetization and loobeans)
 
When starting with valid traces (i.e. assuming that the constraints hold) functional correctness holds.
In the column based model he can prove that computation matches specification for ADD/SUB (so functional correctness)
Essential uniqueness follows from the lemma, by duplicating the inputs.

Joanne:
using FFA in DAFNY possible
primary focus is finite fields (working modulo some prime)
some success in proving completeness
Update on architecture and individual modules: 
- idea: ``trace mechanism``
  - goal is to describe arbitrary sequence of instructions for a module
  - proof by induction
  - starts with the empty (i.e. trivial) trace
  - theorem establishes that the trivial trace is valid
  - the trace mechanism embodies the induction
  - it takes as input an existing (valid) trace `T` + (e.g.) wcpData object `d`
  - it outputs an updated trace `T'`
  - proving that valid input traces remain valid after mechanism i.e. `validWcp(T')`
- set up this **mechanism** for several modules
- validity check (theorem?) `validXXX` works with single constraints at a time, e.g. 73 for WCP module
- works with _arbitrary_ (e.g.) wcpData objects
- builds a ``canonical trace`` from a sequence of (e.g.) wcpData objects
  - Dafny does a lot of data type checking in the background
  - proves completeness of entire module
  - was able to find a missing constraint from older version of spec
  - should help with functional correctness
  - what are the requirements for the wcpData object ? relationship between obcopde and arguemnt ? is the output part of the wcpData ?
  - with David automate the empty file and update function, predicate (i.e. DAFNY version of constraints)
  - summary:
      - WCP tracing, mechanism, constraints, empty proofs verified, verified 53 of 73 constraints update proofs
          - shifting is an issue, esp. 8 bit shifting for SLT, SGT
          - shift by 1 is conquered, others should follow
          - result constraints of the spec
      - ADD similar state (missing 2 constraints)
      - SHF, BIN trace mechanism
  - soundness / functional correctness possible (but in this trace update mechanism)
  - it's basically showing completeness
  - references stack ... it's really about the building of the trace of a sequence of requested instructions

could be used to prove soundness once we have the scaffolding
except for the fact that we may lose type constraints in the general case (for never called computations)


Note:
    - completeness (Joanne) and
    - soundness (Alex) could be used in a synthesis where starting from a constraint valid trace we extract with scaffolding instuctions and inputs, and with Joann's stuff
