Note that our implementation of the tracers is, modulo implementation errors and spec errors, \textbf{one} way to construct traces which satisfy $\zkEvmConstRel(\fullTrace) \equiv 1$. We produce valid tracing by pegging ourselves to an \evm{} execution client. In a future where the prover is decentralized we must ask: are the traces produced by our tracer implementation essentially unique ? Or are there fundamentally different ways to produce traces $\fullTrace'$ with 
\[
	\zkEvmConstRel(\fullTrace') = \mTrue / \mFalse
\]
Our Java implementation of the tracer is \textbf{but one way} to construct objects in the trace space. There is obviously no shortage of objects in the trace space, but the contention is that in some sense there should be, modulo some caveats expounded upon in section~\ref{formal: uniqueness}
