Consistency properties, like structural properties, are macroscopic properties of traces, but nonlocal ones. Their enforcement is typically done with local constraints that apply to a row-permutation of the underlying trace. Examples include: stack, storage, account, context consistencies in the \hubMod; revert data consistency in the \hubMod{} module; memory consistency in the \mmioMod{}; memory size consistency in the \mxpMod{} module; etc \dots{}
