Some constraints work on a very high level and dictate the ``global shape'' of the module.
They are macroscopic properties of modules that are typiclally defined using local rule.
Their purpose is to provide an unambiguous \textbf{scaffolding} for finer structures to sit in.
These are typically constraints to be found in the ``heartbeat'' section of the specification / \corset{} files.
For instance for stateless modules Ã  la \wcpMod, \addMod, \shfMod, \dots{} they dictate the large scale structure of the trace which dictates what rows are part of the processing of a given instruction, what separates these chunks of rows that pertain to a given instruction processing etc\dots{} 

For these large scale constraints we want a \textbf{uniqueness of scaffolding} property.
