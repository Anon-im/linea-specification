The work which the arithmetization team does happens on two distinct levels. On one level we are \textbf{specifying a vast constraint system} $\fullConstraints$. On the other hand we are \textbf{implementing (so-called) tracers}. The two workstreams are closely related and in dome sense dual to one another.
