\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\EXOSTAMP{}$: stamp column of the public data info module; starts at zero, may stay there for a few rows; as soon as nonzero it increments by one with every row; abbreviated to $\exoStamp{}$;
	\item $\shaNum$: counts the number of \inst{SHA3} instructions that took place in a batch;
	\item $\logNum$: counts the number of \inst{LOG0}-\inst{LOG4} instructions that took place in a batch;
	\item $\txNum$: counts the number of transactions that are in a batch;
	\item $\iNum$: imported column; depending on the instruction, contains either $\shaNum$, $\logNum$ or $\txNum$;
	\item $\iAddr$
	\item $\iXSHA$: imported binary flag that lights up for \inst{SHA3} instructions; abbreviated to $\ixSha$;
	\item $\iXLOG$: imported binary flag that lights up for \inst{LOG0}-\inst{LOG4} instructions; abbreviated to $\decxLog$;
	\item $\iXROM$: imported binary flag that lights up for temporarily successful deployments; abbreviated to $\ixRom$;
	% \item $\iXTXCD$: imported binary flag that lights up with every new transaction; abbreviated to $\ixTxcd$;
