\subsubsection{\cs{} constraints and bytehood proofs}


The bytecode of a smartcontract cannot contain more than \texttt{0x6000} = 24576 bytes. We must thus enforce that $0\leq \CS{}\leq 24576$, for which it is enough to prove that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $0\leq \CS{} $ fits into two bytes,
    \item $0\leq \DCS{}$ fits into two bytes where $\DCS{} = 24576 - \CS{}$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that $0=\CS{}$ is true of externally owned accounts. We thus introduce four byte columns (two which handle the byte decomposition of $\CS{}$ into two bytes, two that do the same for $\DCS{}$.) We interleave these columns with \opc{} and produce an associated bytehood proof.
