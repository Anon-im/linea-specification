\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\trmStamp$:
		stamp column; starts at $0$ and grows by 1 with every served request; like many other stamp columns its main purpose is to separate the different requests to that module;
	\item $\rawAddrHi$ and $\rawAddrLo$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccc{}; contains the high and low part of some stack value which ought to be interpreted as an address;
	\item $\trmAddrHi$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccc{}; contains the trimmed version of the high part of the address argument;
	\item $\isPrecompile$:
		\godGiven{}
		\ccbc{}; equals $1$ \emph{if and only if} the trimmed address is in the range $\{1, 2,\dots, 9\}$;
	\item $\ct$:
		counter column: counts continuously from $0$ to $\llargeMO$ and resets;
	\item $\byteCol{HI}$ and $\acc{HI}$:
		byte column and associated accumulator column;
	\item $\byteCol{LO}$ and $\acc{LO}$:
		byte column and associated accumulator column;
	\item $\acc{T}$:
		accumulator column; accumulates some of the bytes from $\byteCol{HI}$;
	\item $\plateauBit$:
		binary column that implements a \textbf{binary plateau constraint} in that it switches from $0$ to $1$ when $\ct_{i} = 12$;
	\item $\bit{1}$:
		binary column; used in establishing that a (trimmed) address is that of a precompile.
