The $\plateauBit$ column is a binary colum that hovers around zero until $\ct$ reaches the value 12 at which point it switches to 1. The associated constraints are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \plateauBit{} is binary;
	\item \If $\ct_{i} = 0$ \Then $\plateauBit_{i} = 0$ \quad (\trash);
	\item \If $\ct_{i} \neq 0$ \Then $\plateauBit_{i} \in \{ \plateauBit_{i - 1}, 1 + \plateauBit_{i - 1} \}$;
	\item \If $\ct_{i} = \llargeMO$ \Then \big($\plateauBit_{i - 4} + \plateauBit_{i - 3} = 1$\big);
\end{enumerate}
These constraints enforce that over a counter-cycle (i.e. $\llarge$ rows where $\ct$ counts from $0$ to $\llargeMO$) $\plateauBit$ is constant $= 0$ for the 12 first rows then jumps to $1$ and stays there until the end of the counter cycle.
