The \textbf{Tiny Euclidean Division Module} \eucMod{} computes \quotient{}'s and \remainder{}'s of euclidean divisions with tiny inputs,
i.e. where both arguments, 
\dividend{} and 
\divisor{}, are (at most) 8 byte integers and 
\divisor{} is \textbf{nonzero}
\[
	\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
		\col{a} = \col{b} \cdot \col{q} + \col{r} \text{ with } 0 \leq \col{r} < \col{b} \vspace{2mm} \\

				0 \leq \col{a} < 256 ^ \mmedium \\
		0 <    \col{b} < 256 ^ \mmedium \\
	\end{array} \right.
\]
Such computations may be required by other modules (e.g. the \mmuMod{} module) where it may prove cheaper to offload said computations rather than to perform them \emph{in situ}.
% TODO: \mxpMod{}, \modMod{}

\saNote{} As already pointed out, the present module is only equipped to deal with divisions where the \divisor{} is \textbf{nonzero}. 
This limitation has to be taken into account by modules which defer computations to the present module.
This inability to deal by division by zero stems from the specification of the lookup to the \wcpMod{} module which expects the comparison (\inst{LT}) between the \remainder{} and the \divisor{} to return a result of one, see section~(\ref{euc: lookup}). 
% TODO: update description whenever we offload MOD instructions to it ...
