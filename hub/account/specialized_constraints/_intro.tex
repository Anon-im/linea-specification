In this section we define certain (parametrized) constraint families applicable to account rows.
The introduction of said named constraint families will simplify the specification process as well as enhance readability.

\saNote{} Whenever we write $\texttt{constraintName}\Hori$ the implied interpretation is that the constraint in question is \textbf{horizontal} i.e. internal to a given row.
Such constraints will typically involve pairs of ``account-row-columns'' of the form $\accountSignifier\col{COL}$ and $\accountSignifier\col{COL}\new$.

\saNote{} Similarly, whenever we write $\texttt{constraintName}\Verti$ the implied interpretation is that the constraint in question will span two (or more) consecutive rows, making it \textbf{vertical}.
Such constraints will typically be used in constraints which undo others.

\saNote{} Special care must be taken to ensure that any constraint involving some ``account-row-columns'' value only be applied when all values in sight in fact live on account-rows.
In other words if a constraint involves a value $\accountSignifier\col{COL}_{j}$ then $j$ should be the row index of an account-row i.e. should satisfy $\peekAccount_{j} = 1$.
