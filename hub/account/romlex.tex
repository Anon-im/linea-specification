The \accRomLexFlag{} will be set manually in the instruction processing of various (account touching) instructions.
Here we simply impose that the \accRomLexFlag{} may only be triggered when the account's (updated) byte code is nonempty in terms of its size.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \If $\accCodesize\new _{i}Â = 0$ \Then $\accRomLexFlag _{i} = 0$
\end{enumerate}

\saNote{}
There are times when the account associated with an address may have
\emph{nonzero code size} yet the account is considered to have
\emph{empty code} (as witnessed by its account hash being $\emptyKeccak$.)
This is e.g. the case while the account is undergoing deployment (and the associated initialization code is nonempty.)
