We present the heartbeat of the \hubMod{} module.
We introduce the various processing phases that a transaction goes through and explain the \hubStamp{} which is used to timestamp certain operations in the \hubMod{} module.
We draw the reader's attention to the fact that our arithmetization of the \textsc{evm} makes a \textbf{fundamental distinction} between transactions.
There are those transactions that require code execution (characterized by $\txSkip \equiv 0$) and those that don't (characterized by $\txSkip \equiv 1$.)
Transactions are uniquely identified by an absolute transaction number $\absTxNum$, see section~\ref{hub: heartbeat: absTxNum and batchNum}, which grows linearly from transaction to transaction.
