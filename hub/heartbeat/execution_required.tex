We explain the remaing cases i.e. those cases where \evm{} execution is required. These are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the transaction is a \textbf{message call} and the recipient account has \textbf{nonempty code};
	\item the transaction is a \textbf{contract deployment} with \textbf{nonempty initialization code};
\end{itemize}
Transaction processing goes through four distinct \textbf{processing phases}.
The first of these phases (and only optional phase) is the \textbf{prewarming phase}.
It is characterized by $\txWarm \equiv 1$.
In that phase all \emph{addresses} to be prewarmed as well as all \emph{storage keys} to be prewarmed (as declared in the transaction) are loaded into the \hubMod{} and their warmth is switched on.
There are thus as many rows in the prewarming phase as there are addresses to prewarm \emph{plus} storage keys to prewarm.
Every row of the prewarming phase peeks either
into the state (i.e. $\peekAccount \equiv 1$) if it is prewarming an address or
into storage (i.e. $\peekStorage \equiv 1$) if it is prewarming a storage key.
If there are no addresses (and thus no storage keys) to prewarm this phase is skipped (i.e. it occupies zero rows and $\txWarm \equiv 0$ throughout the transaction.)
The arithmetization ensures sure that \textit{all addresses and storage keys} to prewarm are indeed prewarmed and no others can be prewarmed.
\ob{TODO: connect to the relevant module linking section.}

The second phase is the \textbf{initialization phase}.
It is characterized by $\txInit \equiv 1$ and occupies $\nsrTransactionInitializationPhase$ rows.
The first two rows peek into accounts (i.e. $\peekAccount \equiv 1$)
and the third row peeks into transaction data (i.e. $\peekTransaction \equiv 1$.)
%
The first row peeks into the \texttt{from} address.
It reduces the balance by the value field of the transaction ($T_\textbf{v}$ i.e. $\txValue$),
pays for the gas limit ($T_\textbf{g}$ i.e. $\txGasLimit$) at the effective gas price ($\txGasPrice$),
compares the nonce $\accNonce$ to that provided in the transaction ($T_\textbf{n}$ i.e. $\txNonce$) and increased by 1;
it also switches on the account's warmth.
Paying for gas and value requires sufficient balance and we thus raise $\debit \equiv 1$ with $\balx \equiv 0$.
The second row peeks into the \texttt{to} address.
It raises its balance by $T_\textbf{v}$,
raises its nonce from $0$ to $1$ in case of a deployment transaction
and switches on the recipient account's warmth.

The third phase is the \textbf{execution phase}.
It is characterized by $\txExec \equiv 1$. This is the phase where instructions are read from bytecode and executed upon. Besides updating the stack and calling on other modules, dealing with certain instructions may at times require us to either
peek either into the stack (i.e. have rows with $\peekStack \equiv 1$),
peek either into the state (i.e. have rows with $\peekAccount \equiv 1$) or 
peek either into the transaction (i.e. have rows with $\peekTransaction \equiv 1$.)
Within the execution phase there can be a myriad of view changes. For instance carrying out an \inst{(EXT)CODEHASH} requires peeking into account data, carrying out a \inst{COINBASE} instruction requires us peeking into batch data, carrying out a \inst{GASPRICE} instruction requires us peeking into transaction data. Also every instruction dealt with peeks into the stack. This peeking can take up one or two rows in the trace (depending on whether $\tli \equiv 0$ or $\tli \equiv 1$.)

The fourth and final phase is the \textbf{finalization phase}.
It is characterized by $\txFinl \equiv 1$. This is the time when the \zkEvm{} ties up loose ends in transaction processing: returning left over gas (+ gas refunds up to the limit specified by the Ethereum Yellow Paper) to the \texttt{from} address and paying the \texttt{coinbase} address; furthermore, in case of a reverting transaction, refunding the initial value transfer. As such, this phase occupies 3 or 5 rows depending on whether the transaction reverts (5 rows) or not (3 rows.) In either case, the first two rows are account rows (i.e. $\peekAccount \equiv 1$) and perform the refunds / payments mentioned above. The first row \emph{always} peeks into the \texttt{from} address' account and proceeds to refund the remaining gas\footnote{The value in Wei to to be refunded is a function of
(\emph{a}) the gas limit,
(\emph{b}) the left over gas,
(\emph{c}) the refund counter and 
(\emph{d}) the effective gas price.
That information is computed in the \txnDataMod{} module. It makes its way into the present \hubMod{} by means of the transaction row yet to come.}. Similarly, the second row \emph{always} peeks into the \texttt{coinbase} address' account and pays it in consumed gas at the effective gas price of the transaction. In case of a transaction which isn't reverted (i.e. which returns status code $\Upsilon^{z}(\bm{\sigma}, T) \equiv 1$) the third and final finalization row is a transaction row (i.e. $\peekAccount \equiv 1$.) If the transaction reverts (i.e. if $\Upsilon^{z}(\bm{\sigma}, T) \equiv 0$) there are two additional account rows: the third and fourth rows are again account rows. They respectively peek into the \texttt{from} and \texttt{to} accounts. The purpose of these rows is to undo the initial value transfer that happened during the initialization phase. The fifth (and final) finalization row peeks into the transaction (i.e. $\peekTransaction \equiv 1$.)

We refer the reader to section~(\ref{hub: finalization phase}) for more details.

The conditions imposed on 
$\absTxNum$,
$\txSkip$,
$\txWarm$,
$\txInit$,
$\txExec$, and
$\txFinl$
impose that each set of row indices $i$ where $\absTxNum$ takes on a particular value $\col{t}_{0}$ is an integer interval and that the four phase bits evolve as in figure~\ref{fig: typical progression of the [b,t] pair}.
