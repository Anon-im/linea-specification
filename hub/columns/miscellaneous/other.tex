The following are ``truly miscellaneous'' columns. They will be used to record information locally with no intention of sending it to other modules for further processing. These columns will be used for dealing with \inst{CALL}'s and \inst{CREATE}'s.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item $\miscChildSelfReverts$:
		binary column; used for both \inst{CALL}-type and \inst{CREATE}-type instructions; prediction of whether or not the \textbf{C}hild \textbf{C}ontext will \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}evert; 
	\item $\miscChildRevertStamp$:
		prediction of the \textbf{C}hild \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{R}evert time \textbf{S}tamp of a child context \emph{given that it self-reverts}; 
\end{enumerate}
We provide some insight into the the significance of these columns.
The acronym \miscChildSelfReverts{} stands for ``\textbf{C}hild \textbf{C}ontext \textbf{S}elf \textbf{R}everts''.
As the name implies this bit represents information (a prediction, really) about \emph{some} child context: whether this child context will self revert or not.
We do not specify at this point \emph{which} child context to consider, what to make of this knowledge nor how to verify this prediction.
We simply assert that this bit will be of importance in the processing of 
\inst{CREATE}-type instructions, see section~(\ref{}) \ob{TODO: add reference}, and of 
\inst{CALL}-type instructions,   see section~(\ref{}) \ob{TODO: add reference}.
