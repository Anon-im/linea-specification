\textbf{Miscellaneous-rows} are characterized by $\peekMisc \equiv 1$ and columns pertaining to that perspective are prefixed with the following symbol: $\miscSignifier$. 
Their purpose is to simplify the writing of certain lookup arguments, specifically those involving
the \mmuMod{} module,
the \stpMod{} module,
the \oobMod{} module and
the \mxpMod{} module.
We therefore introduce the following binary flags:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\miscExpFlag$:
		binary flag; 
	\item $\miscMmuFlag$:
		binary flag; 
	\item $\miscMxpFlag$:
		binary flag; 
	\item $\miscOobFlag$:
		binary flag; 
	\item $\miscStpFlag$:
		binary flag; 
\end{enumerate}
These light up \emph{iff} the current miscellaneous-row triggers a call to
the \stpMod{} module,
the \mxpMod{} module,
the \oobMod{} module and/or
the \mmuMod{}; several of these flags may be on simultaneously. 
The columns in this perspective duplicate pieces of data available in the immediate vicinity within the trace.
All the requisite data \emph{is} available \emph{nearby}, but it is scattered about in a complex way which depends on the instruction. 
The goal of miscellaneous-rows is to make the requisite data available in a \emph{straightforward} way on \emph{a single row}. We introduce the columns of the present perspective by ``topic''.
