We include several columns that will be used in consistency constraints.
The first batch will be used in account consistency constraints, see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: account})
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item $\accAddressFirst$
		\item $\accAbsTxNumFirst$
		\item $\accAddressAgain$
		\item $\accAbsTxNumAgain$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent The second batch will be used in context consistency constraints, see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: context})
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item $\conContextFirst$
		\item $\conContextAgain$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\noindent The third batch will be used in stack consistency constraints, see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: stack})
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item $\stackContextFirst$
		\item $\stackHeightFirst$
		\item $\stackSpotFirst$
		\item $\stackContextAgain$
		\item $\stackHeightAgain$
		\item $\stackSpotAgain$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\saNote{} 
Their names suggest that these are ``permuted columns'' but note that there are no corresponding ``time-ordered'' columns of which they would be a row permutation.
Their names also suggest that they belong to a particular perspective such as $\accountSignifier$, $\contextSignifier$, \dots{} yet they don't properly belong to a particular perspective.
These columns exist purely in the permuted realm as helper columns to achieve degree reduction.
