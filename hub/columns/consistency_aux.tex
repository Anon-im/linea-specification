We will require more columns specifically for consistency arguments.
These auxiliary columns that ``reside in a permuted domain'' will be introduced in the relevant consistency sections, specifically:
\begin{itemize}
	\item account-consistency rows,               see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: account: columns})
	\item context-consistency rows,               see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: context: columns})
	\item execution-environment-consistency rows, see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: execution environment: columns})
	\item stack-consistency rows,                 see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: stack: columns})
	\item storage-consistency rows,               see section~(\ref{hub: consistencies: storage: columns})
\end{itemize}
