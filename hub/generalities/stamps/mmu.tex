The \mmuStamp{} keeps a running tally of all the times some memory instruction is to be carried out and requires a call to the \mmuMod{} module. The present section lays down some general constraints for the \mmuStamp{}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\mmuStamp_{0} = 0$;
	\item $\mmuStamp_{i + 1} \in \{ \mmuStamp_{i}, 1 + \mmuStamp_{i} \}$ (\trash)
	\item $\mmuStamp_{i} = \mmuStamp_{i - 1} + \peekMisc_{i} \cdot \miscMmuFlag_{i}$
\end{enumerate}
\saNote{}
We \textbf{did not} impose hub-stamp-constancy on the \mmuStamp{} column.
There are certain operations that require multiple calls to the \mmuMod{} module.
