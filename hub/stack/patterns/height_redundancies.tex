The  constraint systems that follow typically feature a constraint adorned with the $(\sanityCheck)$ symbol expressing $\height\new$ in terms of $\height$ and other parameters.
These constraints are made redundant by section~(\ref{hub: generalities: stack height}) where we prescribe $\height\new$ in terms of $\height$, $\stackDelta$ and $\stackAlpha$ both with greater generality and with fewer pre-requisites.
We keep the redundant constraints purely to enhance clarity.
They may be skipped in implementations.
