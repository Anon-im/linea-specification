We consider a row permutation $\col{X}\rightsquigarrow\order{\col{X}}$ with the property that the row-permuted pair of columns
\[
	\Big( \order{\cn} , \order{\hubStamp} \Big)
\]
has its entries $(+,+)$-lexicographically ordered. Such a row permutation allows us to list context data displayed among \textbf{shared} in such a way that all data relatitve to a given (nonzero) context number is contiguous and listed chronologically.
