The present section deals with the instruction handling of both \inst{CREATE} and \inst{CREATE2} instructions. These are rather complex instructions in several ways:
(\emph{a}) they can several different exceptions (see section~(\ref{hub: instruction handling: create: intro})
(\emph{b}) unexceptional \inst{CREATE}-type instructions may raise an aborting condition and not be executed
(\emph{c}) unexceptional and unaborted \inst{CREATE}-type instructions may raise a failure condition if the deployment address has nonzero nonce or nonempty code
(\emph{d}) \inst{CREATE}-type instructions that make it past these initial hurdles may lead to (temporary) deployments which may need to be reverted later on.
