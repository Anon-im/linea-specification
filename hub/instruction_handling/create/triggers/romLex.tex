We define the following shorthand
\[
	\locTriggerRomLex \define \scenCreateExecutionNonEmptyInitCode_{i}
\]
Indeed the only time a \inst{CREATE}-type instruction induces communication with the \hubMod{} is when actual (initialization) code is deployed. In all other scenarios (ranging from exceptions, abortgs, failures and (temporary) deployments with empty initialization code) the \romMod{} remains unaffected.
