The present section deals with the \hubMod{} processing of \emph{most} precompiles. We are able to have a rather uniform setup for the following precompiles:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \inst{ECRECOVER}
    \item \inst{SHA2-256}
    \item \inst{RIPEMD-160}
    \item \inst{IDENTITY}
    \item \inst{ECADD}
    \item \inst{ECMUL}
    \item \inst{ECPAIRING}
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
Despite the fact that these precompiles are rather different along several dimensions of analysis:
(\emph{a}) what constitutes success / failure
(\emph{b}) how and when to interact with \text{ram}.
These differences will re-emerge beyond the common setup phase.
