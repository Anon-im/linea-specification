In this section we specify the following ``module trigger shorthands.''
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \locCallTriggersMxp{}
	\item \locCallTriggersTrm{}
	\item \locCallTriggersStp{}
	\item \locCallTriggersOob{}
	\item \locCallTriggersRomLex{}
	\item[\vspace{\fill}]
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\noindent These are binary (by construction) flags which will be used to set certain columns in the processing of \inst{CALL}-type instructions.

\saNote{} We draw attention to the fact that all \col{trigger\_XXX} expressions which we define are \emph{de facto} binary and that binariness need not be imposed by constraint.

\saNote{} These shorthands (as defined in the next few sections) only make sense (and will only ever be used) for row indices $i$ which satisfy both $\peekScenario_{i} = 1$ and $\scenCreateSum_{i} = 1$. These constraints will be imposed starting with section~(\ref{hub: instruction handling: call: generalities}).
