The purpose of the present \gasMod{} module is very simple.
Whenever the \cmc{} flag lights up in the \hubMod{}, the present module is called upon and tasked with checking that
(\emph{a})
the currently available gas after any potential refunds (i.e. \gasActual{}) is nonnegative
(\emph{b})
checking the \stackOogx{} flag in terms of \gasActual{} and \gasCost{}. The only \emph{actual} work carried out by the present module are byte decompositions.
