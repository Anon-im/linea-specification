The Keccak-256 module is comprised of two independent modules which we call the \textbf{Keccak Info Module} and the \textbf{Keccak Data Module} respectively. The purpose is simple: the Keccak info module is connected to the main execution trace. The connection flares up whenever a (paid for) instruction requires one to compute the \texttt{Keccak-256} hash of a slice of bytes, i.e. for the \inst{SHA3} and \inst{CREATE2} instructions. Every such event triggers
