The purpose of this small submodule is to record information and data (in separate modules) relative to
\begin{enumerate}
	\item logging operations,
	\item hashing operations,
	\item and \inst{CREATE} / \inst{CREATE2} triggered deployments.
\end{enumerate}
The information part allows us to uniquely tag individual operations of that kind and extract metadata relevant to this operation. For instance:
\begin{description}
	\item[For \inst{LOG0}-\inst{LOG4}:] the transaction number, the logger address, the log parameter ($\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$), the size of the data to log, four topics (set to 0 for when there are fewer than 4 topics), the log number.
	\item[For \inst{SHA3}:] the size of the data to hash, the result of the hash, the hash number.
	\item[For \inst{CREATE}/\inst{CREATE2}:] a bit which distinguishes between \inst{CREATE} and \inst{CREATE2} instructions, the address which runs the deployment, its nonce delta, the salt, the size of the initialization code, the resulting deployment address, the deployment number.
\end{description}
The Data part allows us to extract relevant data and submit it to the outside proving scheme.
