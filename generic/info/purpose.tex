The purpose of \textbf{info} modules is to
\begin{enumerate}
\item record the output associated with a data slice from the associated data module;
\item record the output whenever the output is known in advance (e.g. the data slice provided is empty and the output is known in advance, this applies to certain precompiles such as \texttt{ECRECOVER}, \texttt{ECPAIRING}, \texttt{SHA2-256}, \texttt{RIPEMD} and opcodes such as \texttt{KEC})
\item record auxiliary data associated (e.g. for logs the associated \col{LogMod} module records the logger address, the 0 to 4 topics and the data size of the data to be logged.)
\end{enumerate}
