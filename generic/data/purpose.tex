The purpose of this generic data module is to provide a framework which is applicable to most data module that are left unspecified in the present specification. The purpose of a data module is to store data with a common destiny or purpose. For instance all data that is to be passed onto the \texttt{KECCAK} circuit, or the data of all logs. Most of these data modules are generic and fall into a set pattern. Others are more involved (the prime example being the 
\ecDataMod{} which does a lot of data processing before sending it off to the Elliptic Curve circuits.) Data modules usually work in conjunction with Info modules. These will record the outputs of the operations performed on the data from the associated data module. Such info modules may also record special events (such as the primitive in question encountering an error, typically this means that it returns
``$\varnothing$''.)
