Rollups are a family of powerful scaling technologies which promise to considerably increase the capacity of the Ethereum Blockchain. An introduction to Rollups, zkEVMs and their role in improving Ethereum capacity can be respectively found in \cite{vitalik_rollup_2021, mediumZKEVM}. Multiple attempts at building scalable and practical rollup solutions have been positively received. zkSync \cite{zksync}, for instance, transpiles Yul into a zk-VM friendly bytecode. Cairo \cite{cairo}, on the other hand, uses a custom architecture adapted to an efficient STARK prover for smart contracts written in Cairo . Other projects, such as Hermez \cite{hermez} or Scroll Tech \cite{scroll} and this project aim to interpret native EVM bytecode, without transpilation or further compilation steps.
