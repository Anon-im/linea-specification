The present document contains a full specification for a \zkEvm{}. Some simpler data and info modules (which typically contain data extracted from the RAM) are omitted. It is based on the previously published \href{https://ethresear.ch/t/a-zk-evm-specification-part-2/13903}{A ZK-EVM specification - Part 2}, itself an expanded version of an older (partial) \href{https://ethresear.ch/t/a-zk-evm-specification/11549}{specification of a zk-evm}.
