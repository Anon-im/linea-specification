The \romMod{} module compiles the \emph{nonempty} bytecodes, initialization codes and deployed byte codes alike, used during the execution of a conflation of blocks.
Its main role in the overall design is to provide the \hubMod{} module with the correct sequence of instructions.
It furthermore assembles the \inst{PUSH}-values from the bytes following a \inst{PUSHX} instruction.
It also tags (in)valid jump destinations as such as required by \textsc{jump destination analysis}.
Most of the arithmetization below focuses on building the \romMod{} module  as a sequence of padded byte codes and of extracting the correct push values from it (i.e. the $\inst{X}$-byte long arguments of actual \inst{PUSHX} instructions).

There are three kinds of accesses to bytecode that the \romMod{} module  deals with, with contract deployment being subdivided into 1 or 2 phases (since deployments may fail):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item loading the full bytecode of an already deployed smart contract to \inst{CALL} it or to \inst{EXTCODECOPY} from it (or both);
    \item deploying a smart contract through a deployment transaction or an (unexceptional, unaborted and no failure condition raising) \inst{CREATE(2)} instruction:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item loading the initialization code into \romMod{};
            \item and for (temporarily) successful deployments loading the bytecode that will be deployed at the relevant address into \romMod{}.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
