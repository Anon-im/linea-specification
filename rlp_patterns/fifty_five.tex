The present section details a simple ``comparison'' constraint which will be used to compare inputs representing the length of a byte string to $\fiftyFive$. We are given the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \col{length};
\item \col{comp} a binary column;
\item \col{acc}: an ``accumulator column'';
\end{itemize}
The interpretation will be as follows: 
\col{length} will be the length we are interested in comparing to $\fiftyFive$;
\col{comp} will be the comparison bit ($=0$ \emph{iff} $\col{length} \leq \fiftyFive$)
\col{acc} will be a byte accumulation column (such constraints will be imposed elsewhere) such that on the row where the constraint below applies one is assured that its value is relatively small. 

\noindent We subsume under the shorthand
\[
    \compareFiftyFive_{i}(\col{length}, \col{comp}, \col{acc})
\]
The following single constraint:
\[
    (2 \cdot \col{comp}_{i} - 1) \cdot (\col{length}_{i} - \fiftyFive) - \col{comp}_{i} = \col{acc}_{i}
\]
\saNote{} This equation enforces the desired interpretation for the comparison bit.
