**Question:** what should happen if you call `EXTCODEHASH` on yourself while you are deploying ?

**Answer:** there seems to be a simple answer. By definition `EXTCODEHASH` returns `0` for empty accounts and the codehash of non-empty accounts. When a deployment is under way the new address starts out with a nonce of `1` and its codehash set to `KEC(( ))`. Thus the address is nonempty. `EXTCODEHASH` thus returns the actual codehash, i.e. `KEC(( )) = c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`.

We are going to test this on using the following initcode:

```bash
init code:
==========

ADDRESS
EXTCODEHASH
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE
PUSH1 0x20
PUSH1 0x00
REVERT
```

- associated bytecode: 0x30 3f 60 00 52 60 20 60 00 fd
- codesize: 10 bytes

We will run the above. Deployment ends in a `REVERT` and we use `RETURNDATACOPY` to read the return data.

```bash
code to run:
============

PUSH10	0x303f60005260206000fd
PUSH1 	0xb0
SHL
//
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE
//
PUSH1 0x0a		// size (initcode is 10 bytes)
PUSH1 0x00		// offset
PUSH1 0x00		// value
CREATE
//
RETURNDATASIZE
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
RETURNDATACOPY
//
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD
```
