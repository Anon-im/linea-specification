All constraints written below take as starting point the processing of a new instruction, which coincides with an increment in the \oobStamp{}. As such:
\[
	\boxed{\boxed{\text{All constraints in this section are written under the assumption that } \oobStamp_{i} \neq \oobStamp_{i - 1}}}
\]
In other words: we are assuming that row $i$ is the first row dealing with a particular instruction.
